This project is a clone of the Udemy homepage, created using only HTML and CSS. The clone aims to replicate the core design elements of Udemy's interface, offering a similar visual and layout experience. Built as a static web page, this project is ideal for showcasing HTML and CSS skills and understanding the structure of a modern, responsive website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page layout adjusts to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes links, a logo, and a search bar styled to match Udemyâ€™s navigation menu, offering a familiar top-bar experience.
- **Course Listings**: A grid layout presents course thumbnails with sample titles, prices, and ratings, closely imitating the appearance of actual course listings.
- **Footer Section**: A structured footer with multiple columns for links to various site sections, mimicking the footer layout found on the original Udemy site.
- **Styling Details**: Careful attention to font choices, color schemes, spacing, and hover effects, ensuring the page reflects Udemy's professional style.
